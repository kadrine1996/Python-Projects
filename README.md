### Web Scraping

For my first python project I `web scraped` data from a *job-posting* site. In order to web scrape I had to parse through HTML to use the correct elements to retrieve the correct data.

> I wanted to retrieve data about programming jobs in Vaughan, Ontario. 

View my code and test out webscraping on different sites.
